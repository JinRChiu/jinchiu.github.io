  INTOR: 'Rebas is a brand that work in cooperation with baseball leagues in Taiwan. It updates the information related to baseball games correctly whenever the game is hold. Attempting to building a digital community for baseball-aholic.\n\nI were in charge of UI design and frontend coding in this project. During the preliminary project, I made a website mockup with Sketch, and started implementing coding tasks with React after completed the design.',
  CONCEPT: 'In this version, the main features are the matchup section and the reports section. Therefore, after discussed with the client, we decided to remove the map section which is at the bottom of the wireframe temporarily.\n\nConsidering web accessibility in all kinds of screen size and mobile size, I simplified the matchup rather than using common  tree diagram. Through such design, it can display team logo and score more clearly, furthermore, clients may put as many games as they want without worrying about space limitation.'
